## Summary

Development of a thermostat with an MSP432P401R MCU. The main goal of this project is to learn some Design patterns explained in the book "Design patterns for embedded systems in C" from Bruce Powel Douglass.

## Sensors and actuators

The sensors and actuators used so far in the project are these:
* DHT11 - Temperature and humidity sensor.
* HD44780U - 16x2 LCD screen with an I2C module embedded.
